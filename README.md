# Real Estate Price Prediction Project README
Welcome to my Real Estate Price Prediction project! This repository hosts the project I developed as my final submission for the course IS597-MLC Machine Learning Cloud. It contains analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models aimed at predicting real estate prices based on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle.

# Project Overview
This project leverages various machine learning techniques to identify and analyze factors influencing property prices in the USA, offering insights into the real estate market dynamics.

# Repository Structure
 - Data/realtor-data.csv: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.   
 - houseprices_MLCFinal.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

# How to run -   
- Clone the Repository: Clone this repo to your local machine to get started with the project using the command:

    Git clone https://github.com/prateekb123/HousePricePrediction_MLC_FinalProject

- Run the Notebook: Run the file houseprices_MLCFinal.ipynb in the repo.


Feel free to explore the repository and use the analyses and models as a reference or for further development. Thank you for your interest in my work!
