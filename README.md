#Real Estate Price Prediction Project README
Welcome to my Real Estate Price Prediction project! This repository hosts the project I developed as my final submission for the course IS597-MLC Machine Learning Cloud. It contains analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models aimed at predicting real estate prices based on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle.

#Project Overview
This project leverages various machine learning techniques to identify and analyze factors influencing property prices in the USA, offering insights into the real estate market dynamics.

#Repository Structure
Data/: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
houseprices_MLCFinal.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire project workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the analyses and models as a reference or for further development. Thank you for your interest in my work!
